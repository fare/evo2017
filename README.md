From Software Creationism to Software Evolutionism
==================================================

Abstract
--------

The lives we live are weaved around the stories we tell.
This is true of programmers as of all humans.
And the greatest of all stories are *origin stories*.
I will examine the origin stories of software,
from simple tales of software creation to elaborate theories of software evolution.
And I will relate these stories to the tools they explain
and the technological realities we bring about by following them.
I will conclude by reflecting on storytelling,
on the progression of the above stories, and on what lies beyond
Stories are fun! And they subtly inform us. Let me tell you a good story…


Background
----------

This is my contribution to
[Salon des Refusés 2017](https://refuses.github.io/)
(a.k.a. SDR2017, with the conference subtitle
"Dialectics for new computer science").
I reused it at the LambdaConf 2017 Unconference,
and will reuse it at the
[NYC N-Languages Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nlanguages/events/238264966/).

I gave previous versions of this talk
at [ENS in 2005](http://fare.livejournal.com/95576.html),
at [MSLUG in 2009](https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/mslug/2009-January/000348.html) and
at [LispNYC in 2014](https://www.meetup.com/LispNYC/events/171997342/)
([video](https://vimeo.com/152109286));
proposals to give other versions of this talk got rejected
by Onward! 2009 and Onward! 2014.


Viewing the article
-------------------

I rewrote and cut down a
[previous writeup](http://fare.tunes.org/computing/evolutionism.html)
to fit the 9000 words limit alloted by SDR:
I added a big disclaimer in the introduction;
I expanded slightly the theory of evolutionism while shortening the text;
I substantially rewrote the latter parts, both adding and removing material.
Here are an HTML and a PDF version of this essay:
