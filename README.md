From Software Creationism to Software Evolutionism
==================================================

This is my proposal for a presentation at
[Salon des Refus√©s 2017](https://refuses.github.io/)
(a.k.a. SDR2017, with the conference subtitle
"Dialectics for new computer science").

I gave previous versions of this talk
at [ENS in 2005](http://fare.livejournal.com/95576.html),
at [MSLUG in 2009](https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/mslug/2009-January/000348.html) and
at [LispNYC in 2014](https://www.meetup.com/LispNYC/events/171997342/);
proposals to give other versions of this talk got rejected
by Onward! 2009 and Onward! 2014.


Viewing the article
-------------------

I am not yet done cutting down a previous writeup
to fit the 9000 words limit alloted by SDR, but you can already proofread
the parts rewritten so far.
